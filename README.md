* Home/About page consists of a profile picture with bio aside and more info below, followed by links to social media accounts
   (LinkedIn, Instagram, and GitHub).
* Portfolio page consists of projects accomplished( blank pictures for the time being).
* Contact page consists of a form to input a name, email and message and a submit button.

On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen whereas on `sm` and larger screens there is some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
pages have been constructed using Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
On each page Navbar is consistent and Footer is sticky.
